An Example on how to build Single Page Applications using HTMX

I am using Nojde.js as a backend with express framework, and im also using Pug as a high-performance template engine for Node.js, which is used for generating HTML with a simplified, indetation-based syntax.

After you clone my reapo to test it, navigate in your terminal to the main folder where also the package.json is, run 
    
    npm install

And after that type

    nodemon app

Then go to the browser and in the port 3000 you should be able to see the web application

    localhost:3000
